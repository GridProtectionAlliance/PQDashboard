Requirements:

SQL Server 2012 or later
IIS 7 or later
Microsoft .NET 4.5
OpenXDA v1.2.1 or later Installed and configured to populate an accessible SQL Server Database.

Instructions:

Set up a virtual directory for the EPRIDashboard application in IIS.

Copy the contents of the decompressed EPRIDashboard folder into the IIS Virtual Directory you created.

Open SQL Server Management Studio, connect to the openXDA database, and run both SQL scripts contained in the \SQL folder.

	Sproc_creation.sql - Creates the required stored procedures for the web services to access the openXDA data.
	
	TableUpdateLatLong.sql - Run this after openXDA has populated the database with your meters. It adds random
		GPS coordinates to your Meter table in the database so that it can show the locations on the map in the
		dashboard. If you have actual GPS coordinates already in the database, skip this step.
