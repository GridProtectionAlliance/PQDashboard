      This targets file makes use of a feature in NuGet whereby a
      file by the name of {packageid}.targets that is placed into
      the build folder will automatically be imported by the project
      file referencing the NuGet package.
      
      https://docs.nuget.org/create/creating-and-publishing-a-package#import-msbuild-targets-and-props-files-into-project
      
      This file will ensure that projects referencing the GSF.PQDIF
      NuGet package will receive the TagDefinitions.xml file, which
      contains names and descriptions for tags as well as for some
      tags' values, into the output directory for that project.
